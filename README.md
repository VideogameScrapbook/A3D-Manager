## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- An Analogue 3D with an SD card

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:TheLeggett/A3D-Manager.git
cd A3D-Manager

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the application
npm run dev
```

The app will open at `http://localhost:5173` with the backend API running on port 3001.

### Quick Start

1. **Connect your SD card** - Insert your Analogue 3D SD card into your computer
2. **Import your games** - Use "Import Games from SD Card" to discover your cartridges
3. **Browse and configure** - Search for games, adjust settings, upload artwork
4. **Changes sync automatically** - When your SD card is connected, changes sync in real-time

## How It Works

The Analogue 3D identifies N64 cartridges using a CRC32 checksum of the first 8 KiB of ROM data. This creates a unique 8-character hex ID for each cartridge. A3D Manager uses these IDs to associate custom label artwork, display settings, hardware settings, and controller pak saves with each cartridge.

### Data Storage

- **Local storage**: All data is stored in `.local/` until explicitly synced
- **SD card sync**: When connected, settings and game paks sync automatically
- **Labels**: Synced via the "Sync Labels" button in the header
